# Simple coding questions

## 1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

> - Asks question about charset/encoding. And use info for quick exit condition.
> - Use a map.
> - Use search based approach.
> - Uses a bit vector(Advanced!).

## 2. Create a function that by a given object, key name and key value - returns a new object with the updated values for the specific key.

> - Duplicated keys?
> - Object in updated key?
> - Mutable vs immutable approach?

## 3. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other.

> - If different lengths - no permutation.
> - Is it case insensitive?
> - Sort strings.
> - Check for char counts - maps.

## 4. Create a comma separated string from all the properties of an object.

## 5. Find the average of an array of numbers.

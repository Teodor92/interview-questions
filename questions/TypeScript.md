# TypeScript interview questions

## 1. Which are the different data types supported by TypeScript? What do they represent?

> `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `object`, `Array`, `enum`, `any`, `void`, `never`, `unknown`

## 2. What are classes in TypeScript?

> They are basically ES6 classes with additional features like access modifiers, indexers etc.

> Using the `implements` keyword.

## 8. How do you call a base class constructor or a base class method form a child class?

> Using the `super` keyword.

## 9. How can you expose a class/method/variable to the outside world?

> Using the `exports` keyword. Same as ES6.

## 10. Does TypeScript support function overloading as JavaScript doesnâ€™t support function overloading?

> Not in a native way, but you can have a single implementation with multiple signatures.

## 11. What is an union type?

> A mix of multiple types using the `|` or `&` operators.

## 1. What is AJAX? How does it work?

AJAX(Asynchronous Javascript And XML) uses a combination of technologies to load content on the web-page dynamically  without a full reload:
- HTML and CSS for marking up and styling information.
- The DOM accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display and interact with the information presented.
- A method for exchanging data asynchronously between browser and server, thereby avoiding page reloads. The XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object is usually used, but sometimes an IFrame object or a dynamically added tag is used instead.
- A format for the data sent to the browser. Common formats include XML, pre-formatted HTML, plain text, and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). This data could be created dynamically by some form of server-side scripting.
